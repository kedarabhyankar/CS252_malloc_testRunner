# CS252_malloc_testRunner
Super simple test runner for CS252 Malloc Lab


Place the tester file by placing tester.sh into the project root. After that, make sure it's executable by running `chmod 777 tester.sh`. After that,
run `./tester.sh TEST_NAME` where `TEST_NAME` is equivalent to the test name in the TESTS directory. Good luck!
